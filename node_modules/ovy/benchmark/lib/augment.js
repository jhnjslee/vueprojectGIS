// The world's smallest and fastest classical JavaScript inheritance pattern (`Function.prototype.augment`) is a [seven line function](http://javascript.github.com/augment/#section-19 "augment.js") which allows you to write [CoffeeScript style classes](http://coffeescript.org/#classes "CoffeeScript") with a flair of [simplicity](http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/ "John Resig -   Simple JavaScript Inheritance"); and it still [beats the bejesus](http://jsperf.com/oop-benchmark/89 "JavaScript Object Oriented Libraries Benchmark · jsPerf") out of other JavaScript inheritance libraries.

// Inspired by giants like [Jeremy Ashkenas](http://ashkenas.com/ "Jeremy/Ashkenas — Portfolio") and [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/ "John Resig - JavaScript Programmer"), `augment` is an augmentation of ideas. Classes created using `augment` have a CoffeeScript like structure, and a syntax like John Resig's; but they are more readable, intuitive and orders of magnitude faster. Plus they work on every JavaScript platform.

// # Change Log #

// 1. `1.0.0` - Extended `Function.prototype` with a method named `augment` which allows you to create CoffeeScript style classes easily in JavaScript using a syntax like John Resig's.
// 2. `1.1.0` - Implemented three new functions on `Function` to ease functional programming - namely `bindable`, `callable` and `applicable`.

// # Extending Native Prototypes #

// The `javascript/augment` library extends native prototypes.  Yes, extending native prototypes is considered bad practice but I'm still doing it because:

// 1. JavaScript programmers are too scared of extending native prototypes. So I'm not afraid that some other library will break my code.
// 2. I pick the names of the methods I'm adding very carefully. For example all other JavaScript inheritance libraries use `extend` to create a subclass. I use `augment`.
// 3. I am reserving some names like `augment` for myself. Don't get mad - Jeremy Ashkenas reserved the [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/ "Underscore.js") and John Resig reserved the [dollar sign](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library").
// 4. JavaScript allows you to extend native prototypes. It's not against the spirit of the language or else it wouldn't be possible in the first place.
// 5. Crockford has dedicated a section about extending native prototypes in his book [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://eleventyone.done.hu/OReilly.JavaScript.The.Good.Parts.May.2008.pdf "JavaScript: The Good Parts"), and he's not against using it.

// # Documentation #

// We wrap up the `javascript/augment` library in an [immediately invoked function expression](http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/ "Ben Alman &raquo; Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)") to create a namespace.

(function (functProto, arrayProto) {

// Check whether `Object.create` exists.

    if (typeof Object.create !== "function") {

// Crockford's [fallback](http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html "Prototypal Inheritance") for the `Object.create` function, with little more descriptive names.

        Object.create = function (prototype) {

// Set the prototype of `constructor` to `prototype`.

            constructor.prototype = prototype;

// Return a new instance of `constructor`.

            return new constructor;

// Declare `constructor`.

            function constructor() {}

// This is an incomplete polyfill for older JavaScript engines. It doesn't support the [second argument](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create#Polyfill "Object.create - JavaScript | MDN") to `Object.create`.

        };

// Dear [Brendan Eich](http://brendaneich.com/ "Brendan Eich"), I think we should implement [three new native functions](https://gist.github.com/4350275 "functProto.js") on `Function.prototype` - namely `create`, `construct` and `instantiate`. Because of the nature of these methods it's necessary to make them native. They'll be greatly beneficial to everyone.

    }

// We extend the prototype of `Function` with `augment` so that any function can be augmented (extended). The method `augment` has a single parameter which is called `classBodyFunction` simply because it's a function which contains the body of the class.

    functProto.augment = function (classBodyFunction) {

// __Line 1:__ Save the `prototype` of the base constructor in a variable called `uber`. We can't use `super` because it's a reserved word and I don't like using underscores (`_super` abhors me).

        var uber = this.prototype;

// __Line 2:__ Create an object which inherits from the `prototype` of the base constructor. This object will be used as the `prototype` of the class, making its instances an `instanceof` the base constructor as well.

        var prototype = Object.create(uber);

// __Line 3:__ Call `classBodyFunction` with the base constructor and `uber` as arguments. The public properties of the class are collected on the newly created `prototype` object. The `classBodyFunction` should return the constructor of the class.

        var constructor = classBodyFunction.call(prototype, this, uber);

// __Line 4:__ If `classBodyFunction` doesn't return a constructor then provide a default constructor which does nothing.

        if (typeof constructor !== "function") constructor = function () {};

// __Line 5:__ Set the `constructor` property of the `prototype` object to point to the constructor.

        prototype.constructor = constructor;

// __Line 6:__ Make `prototype` the prototype of the constructor function.

        constructor.prototype = prototype;

// __Line 7:__ That's it. Simple no?

        return constructor;

// If you think that this is an amazing function and that the code the CoffeeScript compiler generates is a [mess](https://github.com/javascript/augment#coffeescript-like-structure "CoffeeScript Like Structure") then send an email to [Jeremy Ashkenas](mailto:jashkenas@gmail.com "Jeremy Ashkenas") asking him to fix it using this method instead. It's a [win](http://jsperf.com/oop-benchmark/89 "JavaScript Object Oriented Libraries Benchmark · jsPerf") for everyone.

    };

// Store `bind` in a local variable.

    var bind = functProto.bind;

// The function `bind.bind` is a powerful feature which makes a function easily `bindable`. This allows you to make higher order functions like `call` and `apply` bindable so that you may easily bind them to other functions like `Object.prototype.toString`.

    var bindable = Function.bindable = bind.bind(bind);

// The function `callable` is a bindable version of `call`. You may use it to easily bind `call` to other functions. It's equivalent to `call.bind`.

    var callable = Function.callable = bindable(functProto.call);

// The function `applicable` is a bindable version of `apply`. You may use it to easily bind `apply` to other functions. It's equivalent to `apply.bind`.

    var applicable = Function.applicable = bindable(functProto.apply);

// Pass `Function.prototype` to the `javascript/augment` library as `functProto`.

})(Function.prototype, Array.prototype);
